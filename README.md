# SharePad

SharePad is a simple web-based notepad application that allows users to create and share notes with others. With SharePad, you can create notes with different font styles, sizes, bold, italics, underline, and strikethrough options. The application is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use, with no registration or login required.

## How It Works

To create a new note on SharePad, simply visit the website and enter a unique name (at least 6 characters) for your notepad, along with an optional password if you want to keep it private. Once you click on "Create", you will be taken to the notepad page where you can start typing your note. You can format the text using the various options available in the toolbar, and your changes will be saved automatically as you type.

Once you're done with your note, you can share the link with anyone you want to give access to the notepad. The notepad will remain available for 24 hours after the last access, after which it will be automatically deleted.
